# Fast pizza order application - build with React + Vite

This is a web application built with React. After entering their name, users can access the menu page, place orders with a single click, modify quantities, and select orders for priority processing. Finally, by entering their phone number and address, they can complete the order. In the future, users can also use the order number to check the order status.
